    <p>Almost everyone working with fMRI has used or is at least aware of functional connectivity (FC). We have developed a <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10541'>low-dimensional decomposition and generative model for FC</a> which has some very nice properties:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>10x compression</li>
        <li>similar predictive value for reconstruction and residual</li>
        <li>97.3% residual identifiability compared to 62.5% for FC</li>
        <li>modest 5% AUC classification accuracy increase for ensemble</li>
        <li>data augmentations</li>
        <li>ability to generate synthetic FC based on patient characteristics, leading to better intuition and interpretability</li>
        <li>no need to have a population to perform decomposition; a single subject is enough</li>
    </ol>

    <div class='caption'>Fingerprinting with the angle basis residual clearly identifies the same subject scan pairs, while those pairs are less obvious with FC or Factor Analysis.</div>
