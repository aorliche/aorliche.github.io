    <p>Dr. Wang and I will be in Montreal this week, presenting a total of 4 posters. My two contributions are ImageNomer as well as a DynamicDictionary framework that recapitulates several features of functional connectivity relating to children/young adults and males/females. Will try to demo ImageNomer during the stand-by times.</p>
