    <p><b>Update Oct 23 2023:</b> I've made some modifications to the evaluation function. The AI is now very strong from an inferior position, and almost unbeatable from ahead.</p>
    <p>I've finished a <a href='http://45.56.117.175:8000/Durak.html'>multiplayer/AI implementation</a> of the Russian card game Durak. There are two difficulties: easy (random moves) and medium (heuristics + search).</p>
    <p>The search really makes itself known at the end of a two-player game.</p>
    <p>You can have up to 4 players in any combination of humans and AI.</p>
