    <p><b>Update:</b> I've updated the FC-generation model to use a VAE instead of a GAN.</p>
    <p>VAEs are known to have many superior properties compared to GANs.</p>
    <p>My current project involves working in the latent space of functional connectivity and genomic information. To this end, I have created a generative model for the latent space, currently accepting phenotype information and generative sample FCs. The model is essentially a WGAN regularized with FC-specific priors. Take a look, play around!</p>
    <p>Code can be found <a href='https://github.com/aorliche/demo-vae/'>here</a>.</p>
    <p>You can try the original GAN model <a href='http://170.187.142.54:8009/'>here</a></p>
