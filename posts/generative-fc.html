    <p>My current project involves working in the latent space of functional connectivity and genomic information. To this end, I have created a generative model for the latent space, currently accepting phenotype information and generative sample FCs. The model is essentially a WGAN regularized with FC-specific priors. Take a look, play around!</p>
    <p>Code can be found <a href='https://github.com/aorliche/PNC/tree/master/ContrastiveLearningTwo'>here</a>.</p>
