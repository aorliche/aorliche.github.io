    <p>Gang Qu and I recently participated in the <a href='https://ieeextreme.org/'>IEEEXtreme Programming Competition 16.0</a>. Teams were allowed up to 3 members, but we couldn't find a third. We finished 649 out of 6373 registered teams, although only 3521 actually submitted any code. This puts us in the top 19% of competing participants.</p>

    <p>Some of the best team scores were truly impressive, getting more than 90% of all possible points (we got about 25%).</p>
