    <p>Our paper titled "Somatomotor-visual resting state functional connectivity increases after 2 years in the UK Biobank longitudinal cohort" has been published in the Journal of Medical Imaging.</p>
    <p>We find Somatomotor-visual connectivity increases after a few years of aging in the longitudinal cohort, and that FC generally increases with aging in the cross-sectional cohort. This is a more striking result than seen in previous studies.</p>
    <p>The UKB is a great resources because of the large number of subjects (more than 40,000 cross-sectional and 2,722 longitudinal).</p>
