Initially in the game playing space but later agent-based in a persistent environment, where people can create their own agents.</li><li><strong>Geometry-based game design</strong> - fun, STEM-themed games that explore mathematical concepts</li><li><strong>Cryptocurrency for the virtual world</strong> - our virtual agent creation world. According to Elon Musk, currency <a href='https://youtu.be/DxREm3s1scA?t=3180'>\"should be viewed through the lens of information theory\"</a>; the goal of currency is not hoarding but efficient exchange promoting higher overall productivity.</li><li><strong>Neuroscience and neuroengineering</strong> - how do systems think? We want to break into this space.</li><li><strong>Robotics</strong> - David loaned me a <a href='https://category.yahboom.net/products/g1tank'>Yahboom G1 tank robot</a> and is building another one himself. These are autonomous agents in the <u>real</u> world (of amateur robotics).</li></ol></p><p>That is just about all the areas I can think of.</p><p>Please let me know if you are intereseted in any of this stuff!</p>"}
