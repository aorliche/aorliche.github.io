    <p>The ImageNomer paper has been published in NeuroImage: Reports! Open access link is <a href=''>here</a>.</p>
    <p>There is an on-line demo running at <a href='https://aorliche.github.io/ImageNomer/live/'>this link</a>, from which you can also access the documentation.</p>
    <p>I am working on an updated, more optimized version for quicker processing of extremely large datasets such as UKB. It gets rid of the Vue frontend, which was really slowing down when subject number exceeded ten thousand, and replaces it with HTMX. Working great so far!</p>
